Sup. :raised_hand:

This is my blog. There are many like it but this one's mine. :cool:

This is mostly an experiment about leaving behind all social media websites: I wanted to build a place that I can truly call my own, to feel free to post whatever thought or experience I want to share.

I enjoy programming as a hobby, and so this blog is just a crude, hand-crafted website that slowly takes shape and grows whenever I have some spare time. "Minimalism" is not just a fancy word to hide how bad I am as a webdev: what you see is exactly how I wanted it.

Since I'm not much of a writer after all, this blog aims to satisfy my tinkering and crafting whims more than to let me share my thoughts with strangers on the Internet. But I'll try my best to post interesting and well-written content, and I promise it won't just be entirely generated by ChatGPT and the like. In a world ruled by AIs and algorithms using your brain is what makes you unique.
